          <h3>Chapter 1 Able to Listen</h3>
          <p>To one who does the work of the Lord, his personal life matters much with respect to his work. What he is in his character, habit and conduct is essential to his being used of God. This is something to which we need to pay close attention. It speaks of the formation of our nature and the cultivation of our habit. It is more than merely having an experience before God, it involves the forming of character. The Lord has to create a new character in us. In many areas of life we need to be exercised before the Lord until there be developed in us new habits. These things have more to do with our outward man for it is there that we are re-created so as to be fit for the Master’s use.</p>
          <p>Naturally, all this will necessitate the grace and the mercy of God. Nothing is completed on any day. Yet with sufficient light and adequate word from the Lord, all that is of ourselves and which is unfit will be withered and discontinued under the light, while at the same time a new character will be given us in resurrection, through God’s mercy. The few qualities which we shall mention hereafter have been drawn from the experiences and understanding of a number of brothers and sisters who have faithfully served God for many years. If any of these fundamental qualities is missing in a worker, the work of God shall surely suffer.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>One</strong>
          </p>
          <p>The first quality to be mentioned is the ability to listen. One who does the work of the Lord must possess in his personal life the habit of being a good listener. This is not just listening obediently but listening with understanding as well. It is a great need in the personal life of a worker. No one can do good work if he is always talking and never listening. A person whose mouth goes on continually like firecrackers that crack one after another is useless in God’s hand. No workman of God can be always talking. For how can he discern the problem of the person he is conversing with if he is speaking all the time. He is absolutely useless in helping people. When a person comes to you wishing to talk, you must learn how to listen before God. As he speaks, you need to be able to decipher three different kinds of words: (1) the words spoken, (2) those unspoken, and (3) those hidden within his spirit.</p>
          <p>First, we must be able to hear and understand the words spoken. When someone comes to you, you yourself must be a quiet person whose heart is unperturbed and whose spirit is tranquil. You are like a piece of white blank paper having no prejudice, no subjectiveness and no inclination. Within you there is neither decision nor judgment. You place yourself in God’s presence in a state of perfect stillness. As soon as that person opens his mouth and begins to talk, you learn to listen to his words. In quietly listening you are able to know and understand what he is saying.</p>
          <p>It is not an easy thing to listen. How much do you really understand when a brother is talking about a certain problem? Sometimes a dozen people, listening to a brother speaking of just one thing, may hear a dozen different things. What you hear is one thing, and what another person hears is another. And hence, there may be dozens of different conclusions drawn. How terrible it is if a truth is to be interpreted in dozens of ways. Therefore, learning to listen is a very necessary and basic discipline. Learning to understand the words spoken by people is a fundamental lesson a worker of God must learn.</p>
          <p>When someone comes to you with a heavy burden and pours out his trouble, he expects to receive some help from you. But if you listen wrongly, what will happen? Or if you have not heard his story in the slightest but try to answer him with the thought that has been in your mind for the last two days, what kind of mess will you be creating? Suppose, for example, that a person has had an idea running through his mind during the last two days. He shares the same thought with the healthy as well as the sick, with the joyful as well as the mournful. He cannot simply sit down and listen quietly to what someone in need tells him. Do you think he can help anyone? Obviously not. So when someone is speaking to you, you as a workman of the Lord must listen carefully and try to discover what that person is really saying.</p>
          <p>It is a far more difficult task for a workman of God to deal with people’s spiritual problems than for a physician to examine his patients for physical problems. This is because a physician is assisted by the tests performed in the laboratory, whereas a worker for God tests everything with himself. A brother or a sister comes to you and talks for half an hour. During this half hour he places all his problems before you. You know nothing about his daily life nor his family situation nor his condition before the Lord. Half an hour is quite a long time; how are you going to help him if you are not a good listener?</p>
          <p>All God’s workers must develop the ability to sit down, listen and discover the real issue in what they have heard. We who are God’s workmen must train ourselves to such a degree that as soon as people begin talking we can begin to know almost immediately where the cause lies. We soon come to have a clear picture in our mind of the situation. And thus shall we know whether we ourselves are competent to handle the case. Sometimes a brother’s situation is beyond our ability to help. In that case he should be frankly told. As soon as we hear his words, we know exactly where he stands and where we stand.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we must be able to hear and understand the words unspoken. We need to hear before God the words which people have failed to utter. We should discern how much has been said and how much that should have been told but which was not said. To hear the words of the latter is much harder than to hear the words of the former. For whereas in the first case the words are uttered, now we must perceive what are his unuttered words. When people talk, they frequently say only half and leave the other half unsaid. In that event, it is now up to the worker to discern. But should you be undisciplined, you will not be able to hear what has been left unspoken. On the contrary, you will now add in your own ideas which the speaker does not at all have. This betrays something wrong with your own mind. For you bring in by force what he neither conceives in his mind nor utters in his words. You completely misunderstand him.</p>
          <p>In order to judge what a person has uttered and what he has not uttered, you must be open before God. Oftentimes people will articulate what is not pertinent but omit what is pertinent and therefore important. It depends upon your personal dealings with God as to whether you shall be able to discern if the essential words have been spoken or not. So when a brother comes to speak to you, you need to know clearly what he has not uttered as well as what he has uttered. And you must also understand what lies behind his unuttered words. Only then will you have confidence before God as to the way of helping him—be it admonition or reproof or whatever. In case you are unclear yourself, you cannot listen—you simply pour out what is in your own mind. But after you have said your last word, you still remain ignorant of his problem; and thus, you have not rendered any help. The fact of the matter is that a poor listener is of very little use to God’s work. Unfortunately many seem to be plagued with this disease of an inability to hear either the spoken or the unspoken words. If so, then how can anyone expect them to distribute spiritual food in due season?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we must be able to hear and understand words hidden in man’s spirit. Do not only listen to words uttered and unuttered, but also listen to what we would call words in the spirit. As a man opens his mouth and speaks, his innermost spirit is also speaking. As long as he is willing to talk with you, you have the opportunity of touching his spirit; when, however, his mouth is closed, his spirit is shut up within him; and as a consequence, it is not easy to know the words deep inside him. But the moment he opens his mouth, his spirit can begin to come forth. No matter how much he tries to control himself, his spirit will be manifest. Yet whether or not you are able to detect his hidden words in the spirit is dependent largely upon your own spiritual exercise before God. If you have learned, you may know not only the words spoken and unspoken but also the words in the spirit. As he talks you can perceive which few words come from his inner man. And thus you can begin to understand the issue in his spirit as well as the issue in his mind. You are now in a position to deal rightly with that brother. Otherwise, how can you cure his ailment if, after listening for half an hour, you fail to grasp the real issue?</p>
          <p>This ability to listen is truly an urgent need for us workers. How sad that not many brothers and sisters are good listeners. You may converse with them for an hour and yet they still do not understand you. Indeed, the ability to listen is far from adequate. If a person cannot understand what man says to him, how can he possibly understand what God is speaking to him? If he cannot hear clearly the words spoken by people who sit close by, how can he hear God who speaks within him from heaven? If he cannot understand man’s audible words, how can he understand God’s words spoken to his spirit?</p>
          <p>What can you say to a brother if you cannot diagnose his spiritual illness and ferret out his problem? Let us not dismiss this as a small matter. For unless we have dealings in this area, we will not become those who can help people, even though we may study the Bible well, preach well and do many other works well. We must not be preachers only, who stand on a platform and speak to people; we must also be those who can deal effectively with them. How can we possibly render assistance to people if we cannot even hear what is being said? May we see the seriousness of this matter.</p>
          <p>How much time have you spent before God in learning to listen to what people say? Or have you spent any time on this at all? We should spend time in learning to hear the words spoken, the words unspoken, and also the words in people’s spirit. Please understand that a person’s mouth and his spirit may not be in one accord. Many people speak one way, and yet their spirits are in a different condition. Nonetheless, a man’s mouth is not able to hide his spirit forever. Sooner or later his spirit will come forth. And when it does come forth, you will then know exactly where he stands. But without such knowledge, it is rather difficult to help people.</p>
          <p>Once upon a time there was an old physician who knew only two drugs: one was castor oil, the other was quinine pills. Regardless who came to him, he either prescribed castor oil or quinine. He used only these two drugs as a panacea for all sicknesses. Similarly, many brothers deal with people in but one or two ways. No matter what the condition of the needy one may be, they always speak the same words of prescription! Such brothers cannot help people. All who are called and used by God must have this one ability: that as soon as a person begins to speak, they know at once or shortly thereafter what that one is saying. Without such an ability, we cannot heal people’s spiritual ailments.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Two</strong>
          </p>
          <p>How may we hear and understand? First, we must not be subjective. Let us be aware that the chief reason for not hearing and understanding other people’s words is because of subjectiveness. A subjective person is unable to know what others are saying. In the event you have a preconceived idea or a subjective opinion about a certain thing or person, you will not be able to hear what is said to you. For you are filled with your own thought on the matter or person in question. So firmly is your opinion lodged in you that another’s idea cannot have room for consideration.</p>
          <p>Returning to our story earlier, regardless the kind of sickness, the doctor of our story has predetermined in his own mind always to prescribe castor oil. So that when confronted by needy people, he only dispenses this prescription. The same is true in the spiritual realm. How can a similarly inclined person possibly hear other people and thus help them? When brothers and sisters come to him, he is in no position to understand and render assistance in their spiritual problems. He has already decided beforehand to say certain words to them; and aside from these words, he has nothing else to say. He may have great confidence in himself, but he has no knowledge of people’s difficulties. How, then, can such a person do the work of God?</p>
          <p>We must therefore ask the Lord to teach us not to be subjective. Let us say to the Lord, “Lord, cause me to have neither prejudice nor pre-diagnosis when I come into contact with people. Lord, it is not for me to decide what sickness he should have, but cause me to find out what sickness he actually does have.” Let us learn before God not to be subjective; let us not be set in our own idea or view. Let us listen carefully. Let us try to touch the hidden cause and discern the real problem.</p>
          <p>Second, we must not be absent-minded. Many brothers and sisters are undisciplined in their thought life. Their mind is constantly revolving about with never-ending thoughts. They think of this and think of that; their mind is always full of different ideas. And thus, there is no way for other people’s thought, as expressed by their words, to penetrate into their mind. Their brain is never at rest. They are so occupied with their own ideas that they are not able to accept and consider another’s thought. In view of this, our mind must be disciplined if we wish to listen to what people say. For when a mind revolves like a wheel, nothing else can get in. When a workman of the Lord listens to another brother or sister, his own mind needs to be stilled. Not only must his will not be subjective; his mind must be still as well. We must learn to think what another thinks and to hear what another says, even to hear the thought within the words. Otherwise, we are of very little usefulness.</p>
          <p>Third, we must be sensible to others’ feeling. Here is another basic requirement to being a good listener, which is, that as we listen, we need to touch that person’s feeling. In order to reach an understanding, we must enter into the other’s feeling as we listen to his words. Suppose a person is in deep sorrow and distress, but your own spirit is carefree and jolly. In that case, though you may hear a great deal, nevertheless, nothing registers. This is because your feeling is not in harmony with his feeling. And as a consequence, you cannot comprehend what has happened to him. So that one whose emotion has not been disciplined cannot enter into another’s emotion. Unless a person has been dealt with before God, he cannot sing hallelujah at people’s joy nor shed tears at their sorrow; and accordingly, he is unable to hear what they say.</p>
          <p>How can we enter into the feelings of other people? We must keep our emotion sufficiently neutral. The one who comes before you has his own feeling, and unless your own feeling is neutral you have no ability to feel what he feels. You will be so busily occupied with what you yourself feel that you will be totally unable to know and to enter into how he feels. For the sake of the Lord, we become servants to all the brethren. We give them not only our time and our energy but also our feeling and emotion. This is truly a very weighty matter. In addition to helping people in their affairs, we also enter into their feelings by keeping our own feelings and emotions free. And since our own feelings are free and thus at their disposal, we may easily enter into the feelings of others. This is the meaning of how our Lord Jesus Christ, having been tempted and tested and tried in all things, is able to sympathize with us fully (see Heb. 4.15; cf. 2.18).</p>
          <p>What has thus far been said above goes to explain the reason why our emotion must be dealt with. Our affection, having been dealt with, will no longer be self-engrossed; we must not only reserve time and energy for people, we must also reserve our feeling for them. This means we keep neutral our own emotions—be they love or joy or sorrow—whenever we listen to people, so that we may more easily enter into another’s emotions. Otherwise, one single feeling of ours may so possess us and fill us that we have no spare room into which to accept another’s feeling and thus be able to answer his need.</p>
          <p>For one who learns to serve the Lord, the demand of God upon him is very high. He has no time to be joyful for himself, or to be sad for himself. For if he remains joyful or sorrowful, loving or hating in or for himself, he is already so engrossed and filled with his own self that he has no emotional strength left by which to supply the needs of brothers and sisters. Let us therefore understand that God’s workman must always hold his emotions in neutrality within himself, otherwise, he will be like a house so full of things that there is no room for anything else.</p>
          <p>Many brothers and sisters are unable to do the work of God because they have already exhausted their love. They cannot undertake anything else. We ought to know that our soulical power is as limited in its capacity as is our physical power and strength. Our affection does have a limit. If we expend more of it in this or that area, we have less or even none remaining for another area.</p>
          <p>Is it strange or incorrect to say that he who loves people too much cannot work for the Lord? Yet Jesus said this: “If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple” (Luke 14.26). Why is this so? Because in loving these people, we have used up all our love. We should love instead the Lord our God—and do so with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our strength and with all our mind. We must take all our love and pour it upon God. It is a good thing if one day we put ourselves to the test and discover how limited we are in our affectional life as well as in other areas of life. We need to know that our capacity is limited. We are like a boat so filled to the full that no more load can be added. As a matter of fact, we do indeed have our limit. In order to enter into the feeling of others, therefore, we need to keep in ready reserve our own feeling, our own affection and our own thought—for God and for others. Then and only then may we as servants of God enter into the feelings of many brothers and sisters.</p>
          <p>When our two hands are occupied with some work, we are unable to take up any more. When our heart is already heavily laden, we cannot take in others’ burdens. He who is emotionally self-indulgent the least embraces the emotional needs of others the most. Someone may love himself too much; someone may love his family too much. If so, such a person will always be in lack in regard to the matter of loving the brethren. For a man’s love is only so great; unless he lays down other loves, he really has no love for the brethren. Yet brotherly love, we know, is one of the cardinal requirements in the work of God.</p>
          <p>For this reason, the fundamental condition of divine work is to know the cross. He who does not know the cross is useless in the Lord’s work. Without the experiential knowledge of Calvary, one is, without exception, a subjective person. If one does not know the cross, his own thoughts will flow ceaselessly like a river. If one does not know the cross, he can only live in his own feeling. Consequently, it is imperative that we know the cross. There is for us no easy way or shortcut. We must have this basic dealing before God, without which we have no spiritual usefulness. Learn to look for the Lord’s merciful dealing with us so that we are delivered from being subjective, from absent-minded woolgathering, and from being insensitive to others’ feeling. A workman needs to open himself up to receive people’s problems. And by so doing he shall be able to know the words spoken or unspoken, and even their very spirit.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Three</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Now as we who would do the Lord’s work thus begin to listen, our listening power will be greatly improved. Our understanding will increase to such a degree that the moment a person opens his mouth we know what he is saying. Let us remember that except we are like a piece of white, blank paper within, no additional word can be written on it. To hear and understand what people are saying, we need to be in a state of tranquillity, without our own thought, preconceived idea or personal feeling, so that we may quietly listen. What is essential to a worker is not how much knowledge he has but rather what kind of person he is. Because we have nothing, instrument-wise, but our own self, God will use us as a person to measure other people. But if we are not right, we cannot be used by God. Today we are not using a physical instrument to examine people. It would be much simpler if there were such a physical instrument by which to examine or measure other people spiritually. A thermometer, for example, can easily measure body temperature. But in the Lord’s work, that thermometer is we ourselves. You and I as a person must test out other people’s state and condition. Consequently, what kind of person we are as God’s instrument is of extreme importance. If we are a wrong or bad instrument, nothing can be accomplished, since there is no way for God to use us in dealing with other people. To be a good listener, therefore, is exceedingly essential as a first step towards being an effective workman for the Lord.</p>
          <p>For example, someone comes to talk with you to share his difficulty. If you have not been disciplined before God, you would be much inclined to give him some teaching. This is really a very common fault of ours, is it not? Whenever people try to tell us something, do we not often immediately open our mouth to teach them before we feel their spiritual pulse and diagnose their spiritual ailment? Many of us are too impatient to hear them to the end. We make suggestions before we know their problems. We quickly teach and correct after hearing but a few words. How, then, can people possibly receive real help from us?</p>
          <p>Yet does this mean that we must sit there and let people talk for three or five hours? That would not be right either. For some people would speak for hours and expect you to listen to them at such length. We cannot allow people to talk on indefinitely. Generally speaking, we should give them sufficient time to voice their problem; and hence, we must listen to them for an appropriate time. If we are fairly clear within ourselves, having learned to listen and understand for ten or twenty years, we would hesitate to interrupt people. In order to touch at the root point of a particular situation, a certain amount of time in listening is required. Remember that our work is quite complex, inasmuch as we are dealing with living beings who have real problems and serious spiritual perplexities before God. We must never say or interject anything before we have touched the root cause in a given situation. How can we give our judgment when we are not even clear about the situation? In view of the fact that we are dealing with living persons, real problems and spiritual perplexities, we ourselves need to be unprejudiced and quiet before God. The number one reason why many are not able to help others is their inability to listen. Let us therefore ask God to give us grace that while people are speaking to us, we may be able to sit there, listen quietly and understand what is being said. Except we listen carefully, we will never comprehend. Understanding is the key to successful service. It is not easy to speak, but it is even harder to listen. Many preachers are accustomed to speaking, and hence they in particular find it rather difficult to sit down and listen. But this is the first lesson we must all learn.</p>
          <p>Failure to be transparent within, to listen, understand and touch the feeling behind the words we hear will cause extreme difficulty for us in our service to the Lord. Let us try to see if we can hear what people say, let us try to see if we can understand them. Outward calm alone is not enough; we need to have that fundamental dealing before God, which is a dealing with our subjectiveness, our thoughts and feelings. Many dealings can be spared, but this fundamental dealing is a must. Without it we may be listening outwardly yet be dark within; and therefore, we do not understand. We are to be God’s instrument, and if a true instrument, we can know whether a person is hot or cold, normal or abnormal, because we have become that true spiritual thermometer. But if we are not sensitive, we will diagnose wrongly.</p>
          <p>There is a mistaken idea abroad among Christians. They often think that as long as a worker can speak, all is well. On the contrary, all is not well. In order to do the work of God it is not only a matter of speaking, it is also a matter of the spirit. We need to discern the manifold problems among brothers and sisters and know how to lead them. Can we help them if we are insensitive and dark within, so that we are unable to perceive their actual condition?</p>
          <p>When you preach the gospel to a sinner, how do you know whether or not he is saved? Is it through what he says? No, you know in your spirit. How do you know he belongs to the Lord? Is it because he says, “I believe in Jesus, so I am saved”? Do you baptize whoever recites that formula? Not at all; instead, you know inwardly. For you are the spiritual thermometer, that instrument of spiritual discernment. And just as you measure an unbeliever with that thermometer and that instrument, so you measure a child of God with the same instrument. How do you know that the spiritual condition of a child of God is normal? You know and discern by the light in you yourself as the thermometer of God. For this reason, we need to be dealt with by God to the degree that we become a true and effective spiritual thermometer—a true and effective spiritual instrument in God’s hands. But if there is a flaw within, we will be prone to err, and the result will be dreadful. What is therefore needed within us is spiritual light.</p>
          <p>How sad that many brothers and sisters cannot sit down and listen because they are dark within. Let us realize that we must learn to be quiet and to understand what people say. We must open ourselves to take in other’s burdens. And then, by the inner registration we will know wherein lies the problem and how to help.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <article>
          <h3>Chapter 2 Must Love All Mankind</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>One</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Those who work the work of the Lord must not only love the brethren but also love all mankind. “Whoso mocketh the poor,” said Solomon, “reproacheth his Maker” (Prov. 17.5a). All men are created by God; therefore all are to be loved. If a worker does not have sufficient love for the brethren, or if he has the love of the brethren but no love for mankind in general, he is not qualified to serve God. For loving men or showing love to men is an essential quality to have in God’s service. All who view people with annoyance and despise them are definitely unfit to be the Lord’s</p>
          <p>We ought to see that though all men have fallen, they are nonetheless the object of the redemption of our Lord Jesus inasmuch as they were all created by God. In spite of their hardness of heart, the Holy Spirit still convicts them. The Lord Jesus came to this earth; He came to be a man. Like the rest of mankind, He grew up gradually from birth to maturity. For God intends to set up on earth a Model Man, a Representative Man—one upon whom rests all the purposes of God. After the ascension of the Lord Jesus, the church came into being, and yet the church is but the formation of a new man. The whole plan of redemption is to exalt and glorify men.</p>
          <p>One day when we come to a deeper understanding of the word of God, we shall find the term “man” more palatable than even the term “the children of God.” For we shall realize that God’s preordained plan and election is to obtain a glorious man. As we gradually perceive the place of man in God’s plan as constituting the focus of His counsel, and when we truly see God humbling himself to be a man, we shall be impressed with the preciousness of man. While our Lord Jesus was on earth He declared that “the Son of man also came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many” (Mark 10.45). The word the Lord says here is so plain: the Son of man comes to serve men. The Son of God becomes the Son of man on earth in order to serve men. Thus are we shown the attitude of the Lord Jesus towards mankind.</p>
          <p>Many who work for God have a serious deficiency, which is, that they are totally lacking in the love of humanity. They lack the proper respect towards men, and they lack as well a knowledge of the value of man in God’s sight. Today we feel elated because we seem to have learned a little love for the brethren. Formerly, we loved no one; now, we can show our love towards the brethren by doing something for them. No wonder we are high-spirited. Yet this is far from sufficient. We need to be so enlarged by God that we come to see that all people are to be loved and valued. Whether or not you are successful in your future work for God depends chiefly on your attitude towards the value of man. The depth of your work is to be measured by your interest and feeling towards men. By this we do not mean your interest in one or two clever or special persons. We simply mean your interest in “man” per se. This is a very significant issue.</p>
          <p>The primary sense of Jesus’ phrase “the Son of man came” lies in the Lord’s tremendous interest in man—so much so as to become a man himself. Such is His interest in man; but how about you? Many people do not meet your eyes; many people do not arouse your sympathetic feeling. Let us inquire, however, what the Lord’s attitude towards them is. He asserts that “the Son of man came.” Which means that He takes the place of a son of man among men. He is interested in man, He feels for man, and He values man. His interest in people is so great that He verily stands on the human level in serving mankind. How strange that many brothers and sisters have no interest in man. Should this not arouse our righteous anger? Let us ask ourselves if we really understand what this word “the Son of man came” truly signifies. As we are in the presence of God we ought to see that this word of our Lord Jesus reveals His enormous interest in man. How can we ever think or say that we have no interest in the people we are with? Such an attitude is really preposterous.</p>
          <p>Hence in the life of a workman of God there is another basic element in his character formation, which is, that he has an interest in all people. This, however, is not to suggest that he can choose whom among men he will be interested in—that he will only consider a particular person or persons whom he deems as interesting and lovable. No, he must be interested in man per se. For let us observe the characteristic of the Lord Jesus, that He had a keen interest in all of mankind. There was such a love in Him towards all of humanity that He could say, “the Son of man came.” Suppose we go to a certain place to work for God. If we can say that we come to that place not to be served by the people there but to serve them, then our attitude is proper, our way is correct and our position is right. We shall be like Jesus, the Son of man.</p>
          <p>We should always have in mind that as the servants of God we must not withhold our love in a place until some Christian brethren arrive on the scene. All who hold this misconception—namely, that their love is to be reserved for the brethren only—are unable to do the work of God. Let it be known and unequivocally declared that the love of the brethren comes afterwards, and that it is a totally different proposition. You need to have a love for the generality of mankind and a compassion towards them. For John 3.16 makes plain that “God so loved the world.” What is “the world” here? It refers to all the people in the world, including the unsaved and ignorant. Those whom God loves are the people of the entire world. He loves every one on the earth. If you are not interested in a person whom God loves, and furthermore, if you will love him only after he becomes a Christian brother, your disposition is quite different from the Lord’s; and therefore, you cannot serve God. Your heart will need to be expanded to such a degree that you feel that all people are to be loved. As long as this one or that one is a person, you love him. And only then shall you be qualified to serve God.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Two</strong>
          </p>
          <p>“The Son of man also came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.” So continued the Lord Jesus. In other words, the attitude of our Lord here is always that of seeking absolutely nothing from man. We should be interested in all men and love them, but we also should not have any thought of taking advantage of them or of seeking their service. We should not do anything that would embarrass or defraud them, nor should we look to be ministered to.</p>
          <p>Perhaps you have reached the stage after many years of education wherein you are able to use the term, “my fellow-men.” Yet this term is not meant to be merely a vocal expression; it is meant to signify a sort of feeling. For instance, you have many who are your “fellow- believers.” You are aware that they are your brothers and sisters in Christ, and you have a sense of brotherhood towards them. But let us go a step further. Since you live among so many people, do you also ever have a sense of “fellow-men”? How can you serve the Lord if you do not have such an awareness? All who serve God are “big” souls—that is to say, their souls are so big that they embrace all men in their heart. Just here, however, lies a great problem: many of God’s workmen lack this basic love for people. If the love of the brethren is so weak among us, how can we talk about the love of men? We will probably select one person out of a hundred—or even out of ten thousand—to love! This proves that we do not have the love of humanity in our hearts.</p>
          <p>We ought to remember that all human beings including ourselves are created by God to be fellow-men. Our hearts should therefore be expanded to love all the people whom God has created to be our fellow-men. And this means that we must not defraud them, nor take any advantage of them, nor even look for their service: “for the Son of man also came, not to be ministered unto, but to minister.” As Christians who live on earth, we should account it shameful to defraud a fellow-man. It is not only wrong to defraud a brother, it is also wrong to defraud man—period! Look at the attitude of our Lord Jesus towards mankind. Negatively, He seeks not to be ministered to; He does not entertain even the slightest idea of getting something from man. We, too, must have the same mind continually, that we will not do anything to selfishly gain people’s service or support at their expense.</p>
          <p>By the command of the Lord, God’s children should not take advantage of other people. For the sake of being fellow-men, we must not seek any gain from them. We ought to see before the Lord that all men everywhere are to be loved. And hence, if perchance you have no interest in humanity, then whatever you do before God is going to be very, very limited. For He expects His servants to be of enlarged capacity, to be those who are interested in all mankind. And they shall thus receive grace to serve God.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Three</strong>
          </p>
          <p>“The Son of man also came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many” (Mark 10.45). “The Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost” (Luke 19.10). “I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly” (John 10.10b). Jesus came for all men. He came to minister and to give His life as a ransom for many. This indicates that the purpose of His coming is to serve the world. Of that service, the world of men have a special need which requires His giving His life as a ransom. And accordingly, the Lord Jesus gave His life. In His being a ransom for many, He fulfills the highest and ultimate task of service.</p>
          <p>To quote Him accurately, we must see that the Lord Jesus did not say “The Son of man came to give his life a ransom for many”; He instead said, “The son of man came . . . to minister.” His aim is serving humanity. For He has an interest in all people; He sees them as those He would love and also serve. He serves to meet the fundamental need of man—the need of a Saviour; so He gives His life to be a ransom for many. We are not qualified to do the Lord’s work if we merely preach the gospel of His redemption and yet lack the heart to serve the world.</p>
          <p>Man is to be loved, hence the Lord comes to serve as the Son of man, not as the Son of God. He first serves, first loves, then gives His life for many. First love, then sacrifice. When you go among people, you cannot preach the sacrifice of the Lord if you do not have love. Do not think that before you can love a person you are to preach to him until that person becomes a brother. Not so. Unless you can appreciate the fact that all human beings are created by God, you really are not in the right spirit to preach sacrificial love to them. We must first love men before we can lead them to accept the Lord. We should never wait until they have accepted Christ and become brothers and sisters before we begin to love them.</p>
          <p>It is a matter of deep regret that many today possess this defect and have this problem. They usually keep back their love until people become their brothers and sisters in Christ. Our Lord, however, was not that way on earth. He first loved men by serving them, and then He laid down His life for them. All who preach the good news of redemption must likewise first love men and then proclaim the gospel to them. Our Lord indeed served and dispensed grace to men first before He ever died for them. May we, too, be interested in all people and sense their preciousness; may we, too, show grace to them before we ever present the redemptive work of the Lord to them.</p>
          <p>If our heart is opened by God to see that we are fellow-men, our attitude towards all mankind will be completely changed. We shall feel the preciousness and lovableness of all people. Let me clearly state that it is absolutely essential for you to see the dearness of man in the eyes of God because man is created by Him according to His image. In God’s heart all human beings today remain as those who are originally created in His image. And consequently, you must be a person who loves all people before you can go into their midst and serve them with the gospel. Let us see the lovableness and value of human beings before God.</p>
          <p>Many brothers and sisters who are engaged in the Lord’s work have a wrong attitude towards humanity. They consider the people whom they contact to be a nuisance, a drudgery, a burden or an entanglement. This is a terrible mistake. Let us learn to see before the Lord that man is created by God. Though he indeed be fallen, he nonetheless retains traces of the image of God, and he still has the hope of a glorious future through the gospel of Jesus Christ. In seeing this, we shall then sense that man is to be loved. We shall no longer treat people as an entanglement, a drudgery or a nuisance. Since our Lord has gone to the cross for them, can we love them any the less? One who is really touched by the Lord and who truly understands why He came to this world can readily perceive that human beings are to be loved. It will be impossible for such a person not to love mankind.</p>
          <p>Man is to be loved. All his sins can be forgiven; all his weaknesses may be forborne; and all his carnalities can be foreseen. Because we too are sinners, we can therefore understand the tragic story of man. On the other hand, we also know the value of man. Let us not imagine that the Lord Jesus came to die because of the great number of people in the world. For He himself has explained that the shepherd goes out to seek the one lost sheep (see Luke 15.3-7). He did not come to seek because ninety-nine sheep had gone astray. To the good shepherd, one lost sheep is sufficient reason for him to come and to seek. In other words, even if but one person out of the whole world’s people is perishing, He is ready to come down from heaven to earth.</p>
          <p>Now as a fact of history, He has indeed saved a countless multitude; but so far as the love in His heart is concerned, He seems to come just for that one person, that one lost sheep. The Holy Spirit is as the woman who, told of in Luke 15, sweeps the house and searches diligently for the one lost piece of silver until it be found. He does not wait until, like the woman, all ten pieces are lost before He begins to search for that one lost soul. In the parable of the prodigal, also in Luke 15, the father (representing the Father God) welcomes the one prodigal son who returns. Yet he does not wait until all his sons become prodigals and only then will he welcome them back. No, he welcomes the coming home of even one prodigal son. And so with the heavenly Father too. Hence the Lord Jesus shows us in His spoken parables of Luke 15 that He will do the work of redemption to meet the need, if necessary, of but one single person. He will not wait until the many have needs. All this would indicate how interested is our Lord towards the human race.</p>
          <p>Therefore, in order to serve the Lord well, you must learn to be interested in people. Without such an interest, you can do little. For even if you do serve, what is done will be very limited inasmuch as your heart is too small in capacity to embrace so many people. Not until your interest in humanity grows and your heart is increasingly enlarged can you understand the meaning of redemption and appreciate the value of man in God’s economy. Without this enlargement it is totally unthinkable that such narrow-minded persons as we are can contemplate so great a work. How can we save souls if we do not love them?!? It is impossible to save souls without loving them first. Only when this basic problem is solved can many other problems concerning human beings be resolved. No human lack of knowledge should hinder your love; no hardness of heart should block your love. With love in your heart that has been enlarged, you will not despise anyone; and as a consequence, you shall be brought by God to stand together with your fellow-men.</p>
          <p>When some brothers and sisters from urban areas go to the rural villages to serve, they unconsciously take with them a superiority complex towards the farmers. Such an attitude is despicable. Our Lord has not said, “the Son of God came”; He said, “the Son of man came” (see again Mark 10.45). In order to preach the gospel, one must become a son of man.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, it often happens that when a worker goes to a certain place, he has the feeling of condescending himself. Humbling oneself is a must, but to harbor in one’s heart the notion that his very coming among men is itself a humble act is thinking that is totally unacceptable. If you should have a feeling of condescension when among people of less intelligence or of a lower economic or social standing, your humility will not be natural but artificial. From the human viewpoint, while our Lord was on earth He was seen to be a son of Mary; His brothers were James, Joses, Judas, and Simon; and they and his sisters lived among the people. He was known only as the son of man. You, too, must be known simply as a human being. When you go into the midst of people, do not display among them an air of superiority. If so, your attitude is totally wrong. A Christian should never do this. You ought to be as one of them, without ever creating the feeling in them of your condescension. Otherwise, you will not be able to serve them.</p>
          <p>We may serve only as “man” to “men.” We must never give people a reason to sense that we are trying to condescend ourselves as if we are an altogether different and higher kind of creature. If we do create such a sense in them about ourselves, we are disqualified to be servants of God. In order to serve the Lord, we must truly humble ourselves to the lowest place. In talking with people who are less intelligent or lower on the economic or social scale, we will not be their fellow-men if we position ourselves on a different level than they and give people a different impression.</p>
          <p>Unless we humble ourselves to the lowest point, we cannot serve God. We must be so humble that we never harbor any superiority consciousness. No brother or sister may despise a person disadvantaged in terms of education, economic level or social class. In God’s creation, redemption and plan, this latter person has the same destiny as anyone else. Only in one thing may we be different, and that is, that, unlike the unbeliever, we know the Lord. Oh, do let us see that many of our attitudes may be wrong. Our whole being, whether in our attitudes, feelings or thoughts, needs to be transformed. We must come to realize that all people are equal before God. For if our Lord could come humbly to this earth for them all, can we not also humble ourselves for them? Never make any distinction because of intelligence or any other human factor.</p>
          <p>Some may ask, we indeed must not look down upon a less fortunate individual; but suppose we encounter a person who is deceitful, sinful or corrupted—what should be our attitude towards him? The answer is quite simple: you should recall your own days before your salvation. Were you better than that person? If the grace of the Lord should be removed from you, would you be any stronger or purer than he? Who makes you holier? If you were to look at yourself apart from grace, you would not find any difference between yourself and that particular soul. Apart from what grace has done to make you different, you are no different from him at all. You can only bow your head and say, “I am a sinner even as he.” Grace must cause you to lie in the dust and pray, “Lord, it is You who have saved me!” Grace will never persuade you to lift up yourself. Quite the contrary, grace will enable you to see that you are the same as those deceitful, sinful and corrupted people. What really makes you different is the grace of God, not you yourself. What ever can you boast of, since all you have has been received from God? And if your distinction comes indeed from grace, then you cannot in any way exalt yourself in such grace. Let us praise and offer thanks for the grace of God more; let us not elevate ourselves. In the presence of the Lord, we need to realize that we are just the same as they are; and therefore, we must love them. Though their sins be hateful, nevertheless their person deserves love. And thus shall we cultivate having a large enough heart to lead them to the Lord.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Four</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Let us be reminded once again that all who would be used by God must possess certain qualities which are usable to Him. All who may be used of the Lord are interested in people, deeply interested in them. If a worker were to have a larger and warmer heart and to show greater interest in people, his ministry would be greatly increased. How can we go forth to preach the gospel if we are so cold towards humanity and have no interest in them at all? We may indeed go forth to deal with them to save and to win them. Yet what can we do if we have no interest in them? Why do we even go if we consider them to be a nuisance and offensive? If no physician is afraid of seeing patients and if no teacher is fearful of meeting students, then is it not odd if we who preach the gospel are fearful of man!?! Hence all who wish to do the work of the Lord must be interested in all people.</p>
          <p>Let us see that you and I are not forced to go forth; we ourselves are to be motivated to contact people by our interest in them. We are to go not because we are persuaded to communicate with people, but because we sense the lovableness and preciousness of man in our heart. We need to realize that all these vast multitudes of people around us are created by God. They are loved and desired by Him. He gave His only begotten Son to them with the hope that they might believe in Him and thus receive life. We differ from them on one point only, and that is, we have believed. Yet we should lead them also to believe. And this we must do by exhibiting the greatest interest in and love for them. And then shall we have this unending task of serving them. By the mercy of God, we will become useful workmen in His hand.</p>
          <p>If anyone wishes to serve God well, this path of which we have been speaking must be straight. Let us never forget that every person has a spirit. In this respect, all are equal before God. We therefore ought to love every soul we meet, and we must therefore desire to serve each and every one. Then, when we walk along the street and meet a person, we will sense and view things quite differently.</p>
          <p>Now as a person is enlightened by God to see that his Christian brother and he are born again of the same Father, he will unquestionably exhibit a special feeling towards that brother. By the same token, we workers need to be enlightened to see that both the people at large and we ourselves have been created by the same God. Under such enlightenment, we will manifest an uncommon interest towards any person we meet. Even as already we have a special feeling towards our brothers and sisters because we are conscious that these are our brethren in Christ, just so, we need also to receive another enlightenment from above that informs us that all these countless people around us are our fellow-men. Each one of them is precious, is to be loved, and is worthy of our unending service.</p>
          <p>Now with such enlightenment as this, we shall touch the heart of God, inasmuch as His attention is always towards man. Since all of mankind are created by God, it is our privilege to save some of them and to add them to the Church of God. Although the completing and perfecting of the Church is God’s ultimate aim, His work today is to gain people. No one who works for the Lord can afford to despise a single soul. Any contempt for a soul, expressed in attitude or in deed, disqualifies a person from being a servant of God. In order to serve Him well, a person not only must not disdain any soul but he also must learn to be a servant of all souls. Let us learn to help all people in various ways; and let us learn to serve willingly and not grudgingly.</p>
          <p>Some have the habit of looking down upon those who are supposedly inferior and looking up to those who are supposedly superior. It will be a most shameful thing if such a habit is found among God’s servants. We must not exhibit any attitude of contempt towards those whom we consider “inferior.” We need to go to God to obtain a revelation of the place and position of all mankind in His sight. We cannot serve the Lord if we fail to have this deficiency solved. We must see the value of man, and so seeing, it will be a great and joyous sight. By perceiving how the Lord came to die for all humanity, we will be characterized by His dying love. We will be able to enter into our Lord’s feeling and will sense the loveliness of all men. Only thus shall we show great interest in all of humanity. Otherwise, we are unfit to work for the God who made us all in His very image.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <article>
          <h3>Chapter 3 Have a Mind to Suffer</h3>
          <p>Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye yourselves also with the same mind . . . (1 Peter 4.1)</p>
          <p>
            <strong>One</strong>
          </p>
          <p>All who serve God need to possess an additional characteristic— that of having a mind to suffer (see 1 Peter 4.1). This too is most essential. But before we address this specific question, let us first deal generally with the attitude of a Christian toward suffering.</p>
          <p>The teaching of Scripture is quite plain: God has no desire to see His people suffer. There is a certain philosophical concept abroad which posits the notion that the human body is intrinsically evil— and that therefore we humans must suffer and not enjoy blessing. People with such a concept view any kind of enjoyment as something wrong.</p>
          <p>As servants of the Lord, however, we go forth to represent Him. We ought to be clear that the above concept is not a Christian one. The Bible definitely shows us that God has never purposed to have His children suffer. On the contrary, it plainly tells us that the Lord has not withheld any good thing from us: “Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want” (Ps. 23.1; see also, 1 Tim. 6.17). The words “I shall not want” here, do not mean that I shall have no need. They simply mean that with Jehovah as my Shepherd, I shall not be in need of any kind. For example, if you have just had a solid meal, and someone offers you a bowl of congee (watery rice), you will doubtless say, “I am full, I do not need it.” In a similar vein, what the psalmist is saying here is that, having the Lord as my Shepherd, I shall be in lack of nothing. In other words, God does not desire that we be in lack; on the contrary, He wants us to be full; and so, “no good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly” (Ps. 84.11).</p>
          <p>Beginning at the very outset of the Old Testament record, the Bible consistently reveals to us how God takes care of His people, minimizes their problems and mitigates their sufferings so as to separate them from the heathen nations. Take as just one example the circumstances among the Hebrews in the land of Egypt. The land of Goshen where they lived was different from the rest of Egypt. God’s blessing was always present in Goshen. Hence we believers must not bring this kind of suffering philosophy into our Christian faith. Let us not confuse Christianity by mixing non-Christian notions into it. This is something we need to watch.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, this is not to suggest that God will not test His children nor discipline them: he does indeed test them and chasten them. Yet we need to distinguish this from the philosophical concept of suffering just mentioned. In ordinary times God usually dispenses grace, taking care of, supporting and supplying His own children with whatever they need. But in times of necessity He will also test and chasten His own. Yet even here, this is not to say that He will try them every day. He only chastens when chastening is necessary. He never chastens on a daily basis or at every moment: He only does so sometimes, not all the time. Our God is habitually mindful of us to provide for our every need. Nevertheless, if we persist in our obstinacy in a given area of life, He will have to allow the trial and discipline to continue—although according to His usual way He loves to deal kindly with us and is unwilling to make us suffer. It is the will of our Father God to give all good things to His children. We may therefore receive and enjoy all which the Lord has given to us.</p>
          <p>What, then, is the meaning of the suffering for the saint which we find in the Bible? In the Scriptures we find that to suffer is a path which we deliberately choose to take before the Lord. This is to say that the Lord has indeed provided us with days of abundant grace; but today, for the sake of being God’s servants and serving Him, we instead choose this way of suffering. In short, this path is a selected way. It is not unlike what the three mighty men of David did who could have easily followed their leader and lived on peacefully, but once learning of David’s longing to taste water from the well by the gate of his home village of Bethlehem, they jeopardized their lives by breaking through the host of the Philistine army to draw water out of that very well (see 2 Sam. 23.14-17). Hence to suffer is something chosen by us; it is not ordained. We choose before God to suffer. We are willing to do so for the sake of serving the Lord. According to God’s providence, we may not have to suffer many pains; yet because we desire to serve Him, we gladly choose a path which differs from the common one. And this is what is meant by having a mind to suffer. To arm ourselves with such a mind is a basic characteristic of any person who would wish to serve God. Without this willingness, we will not be able to serve well in anything. Lacking this, our service will be very superficial.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Two</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Yet, let it be clearly known here that being willing to suffer is not the same thing as suffering itself. It simply means that before God I have a desire of being willing to endure hardship, difficulty or trial for the Lord. I am prepared to do so and will gladly do so for Him. And this is having the mind to suffer. Whoever has this mind may not in fact suffer, yet in his mind and heart he has committed himself to do so gladly for the Lord.</p>
          <p>Suppose, for example, that today, God supplies you with food and clothing and better lodging with better furniture. It is not wrong for you to enjoy these things. You may accept from the Lord whatever He has provided; nonetheless, you still possess a heart willing to suffer for Him. Though you do not experience any physical hardship at the moment, nevertheless your mind is still willing to experience that for the Lord. Hence the issue lies not in outward happenings but in your heart desire. When you are in a most favorable situation, do you still possess the mind to suffer? The Lord may not arrange to have us endure hardship every day, but all who work the work of God must not lack the mind to endure such a thing each day. Suffering may not be a daily experience, yet having a mind to suffer must be present daily.</p>
          <p>The problem we face is that many brothers and sisters, as well as members of their families, shrink back at the slightest provocation. They do not possess the mind to suffer. When the Lord arranges to let us have a favorable environment, without any lack in material things, and with a relatively healthy body, we can serve Him daily and well. But once we encounter a little trial and meet up with the slightest trivial problem, our whole being collapses. This betrays the fact that we do not have the heart to suffer. How can we possibly stand any test if we do not have such a heart?</p>
          <p>Having the mind to suffer speaks of my readiness before God to suffer. I am willing to go through trial, and I choose the path of hardship. It is up to the Lord whether or not to put suffering in my path, but on my part I am always prepared to suffer. Thus when His providential change comes and trial falls upon me, I will not be surprised but rather feel that this is what I should go through in the first place. In the event I can only accept God’s favorable arrangement and am unable to endure any trial, then as soon as the circumstances shift in the latter direction, I am broken and my work for the Lord ceases. Now this is a clear indication that I do not have the mind to suffer.</p>
          <p>Do please understand that work cannot wait for you. Whether you have food or not, you nonetheless must work. Whether you are clothed or not, you must nevertheless continue serving the Lord. When you are well you work; when you feel uncomfortable you still work. You serve whether in health or in sickness. By this shall you find out if you are armed with the mind to suffer or not. Yet this is an awesome weapon, before which Satan is unquestionably bound. Otherwise, once trial and trouble come, your work instantly ceases.</p>
          <p>Some brothers and sisters have suffered, and yet they do not see the preciousness of suffering before God. And as a consequence they are not in the least thankful to the Lord. On the contrary, they may at times even murmur and complain. They become apprehensive if such a day does not speedily pass. They may have prayers, but they never give praise. Whatever has come upon them under the discipline of the Holy Spirit they will not gladly accept. They expect such a time to quickly fade away. This kind of attitude plainly manifests their lack of having a heart to suffer.</p>
          <p>Allow me to say that if you do not possess the mind to suffer during peaceful days which the Lord has given you, you will only be able to proceed when the way is smooth, because as soon as the road turns muddy, you will stop serving. This ought not to be so. Let me reiterate what was said earlier, that having the mind to suffer is not suffering itself. You may in truth possess such a mind and yet the Lord may not see fit to give you suffering. Even so, if and when you are in fact touched with hardship or trial, you will not shrink back, because within you dwells a heart to suffer.</p>
          <p>We need to note, however, that not all who suffer have the mind to do so. Many are going through difficulty and trial, and yet they may not possess the mind to suffer. So that among those who suffer, there are those with the mind to do so and others without the mind so to do. Quite a number of brothers and sisters cry almost daily for deliverance from the things they must endure. They are daily in distress, hoping day and night that such a time will soon pass away. Such people have no mind to suffer in the midst of hardship.</p>
          <p>Therefore, let all who are under trials—whether physical, financial or otherwise—remember this: that what counts before the Lord is not whether you suffer, but whether you have the mind to suffer. Make no mistake in thinking that because you suffer greatly, you are therefore enduring hardship and trouble for the Lord. Without a doubt your circumstance is painful, but it needs to be asked how much of a mind to suffer for the Lord do you really have? Do you choose this path of suffering before the Lord? or are you complaining, annoyed, self-pitying and self-seeking when you do suffer? Let it be plainly understood that people can undergo much heart pain or actual physical trial and yet simultaneously have no mind to do so. Possessing a mind to suffer is a much deeper issue than undergoing the suffering itself. To have the mind to suffer may not issue forth in one suffering outwardly; but by the same token, for a person to suffer outwardly may not mean he has the mind to suffer.</p>
          <p>We can also put it this way, that the materially poor may not be spiritually poor, for many who go through much material hardship and trial are rich in the spirit in that they do have a mind to suffer; yet there are many brothers and sisters who, though they might equally be going through difficulty and material hardship, do not have a mind to suffer. And should the Lord allow these latter to choose, they would rather not suffer, neither for a month, nor for a day—nay, not even for a moment. They do not possess a heart to suffer.</p>
          <p>A person who lacks this character attitude shall find his labor in the Lord limited. For when the outside demand exceeds his ability, he will immediately withdraw. He is unable to sacrifice all. What he treasures he keeps for himself. He can only be engaged in the smoothest service during the most convenient days. He needs the Lord to remove all the obstacles for him so that he may work peacefully. Yet how surprising it is that a person who serves the Lord should make such a demand.</p>
          <p>So let us clearly understand what is meant by having the mind to suffer. A brother who is living peacefully may have more of such a mind than he who is actually suffering. In human eyes, of these two brethren, the one under trial is undoubtedly the one who is suffering. Yet in God’s eyes, the brother in peace who definitely has the mind to suffer would be more precious to the Lord. This is because what the Lord values the most in His children is not the suffering itself but their having a heart to suffer. Yet because the Lord has no intention of making us suffer, let us not therefore think that our suffering itself has any merit.</p>
          <p>May we ever keep in mind that the one thing God requires of us to respond well to is to be willing to have the mind to suffer. We must be armed with this very weapon. Without this as a weapon, we cannot fight the battle for the Lord. We will instead retreat at the least hint of hardship. We will not be able to endure the least pain or pay the smallest price. We will immediately shrink back. In view of this, the question to be put to you is not how much you suffer but how much you are willing to suffer. Naturally we would expect a brother who encounters much pain to have received more grace from God. Even so, we may not be able to find help from that brother simply because we later discover that within him there is no heart to suffer. How totally unwilling he is in this area. He has in truth gone through much trial and tribulation, but he has not learned any lesson before God because his heart is full of rebellion. We are therefore shown the difference here between the mind to suffer and suffering itself. We cannot in any way substitute the latter for the former.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Three</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Here we see the dilemma in the Lord’s service. Sometimes, for example, in the work which God has called us to do, we find ourselves in physical need because He seemingly has not provided sufficiently for us. What shall we do amidst such trial? Well, if we stop working because of material straitness, might not our Lord be surprised and might He not be justified in asking us what is the basis and reason for our service? So that in God’s service, having the mind to suffer is a decisive factor. For you cannot come to the Lord and say you quit because you encounter some unexpected difficulty or trial. No one who serves the Lord may stay home during rain and go forth only after the sun comes out. If you have the mind to suffer, then you will work on in spite of privation, difficulty, pain, sickness, or even approaching death. Possessing a mind to suffer, you will stand up and declare to the devil, “I will work on, no matter what may come!” But if you are inwardly afraid, you will fall away at whatever provocation Satan may cast along your path. If you say, “I am not afraid of hunger,” then when Satan threatens you with hunger, you stand firm and the devil flees. If you say, “I am not afraid of coldness,” you will stand and Satan must withdraw when the latter tempts you with coldness. But if you should say, “I am afraid of being sick,” Satan will make you sick and thus you will be vanquished. Without a mind to suffer, you are subject to Satanic attack at this very point of your fear, and you will be finished. But if you declare, “I am not afraid of sickness,” Satan will be bound.</p>
          <p>In the light of all this, every one of God’s workmen must be prepared before the Lord to go forth with a fearless heart. Whatever may happen—whether it be family trouble, physical ailment, hunger or cold—you shall continue to serve. With the result that the Enemy can do nothing to you. Such an attitude reveals having the mind to suffer. On the other hand, when such an attitude is lacking, you will be tempted with the very thing of which you are afraid. And the consequence will be that you will invariably withdraw from the work of God. In short, you become unusable.</p>
          <p>May we all say to God, “For the sake of Your love and because of the grace You have given me today, I am fully committed to Your work. Come heaven or come hell, I will work on. Whether competent or incompetent, I shall pursue the work to its very end.” Without such a heart as this we will be open to the attack of the Enemy at our point of weakness. We will quickly be finished and reduced to ineffectiveness. For this reason we must plead with God to show mercy towards us and grant us this mind to suffer. To have this mind is to be inwardly ready for the Lord regardless what event or future circumstance may overtake us. Having such a mind to suffer does not necessarily automatically incur suffering; probably, there will be no suffering; yet an inward determination anchors us firmly. And whoever has this inner assurance is fortified against trouble of any kind. But whoever lacks such certitude will collapse when confronted with trouble.</p>
          <p>Have you now realized the absolute necessity for having such a mind? The way of service lies not in suffering, but in possessing the mind to suffer. That is to say, you thank God for hunger and nakedness as well as for food and clothing. These things create no difficulty in your life. Neither good nor bad represents any problem to you at all. Please understand that Christians do not ever seek to suffer, they must simply have a mind to suffer. They are prepared to press on in the face of whatever difficulties come their way. But if this should remain an unsettled issue in your life, then nothing is settled.</p>
          <p>Let us take what may occur in travel as an example of what we have been saying here. It is true that some people may be physically weak and need to sleep on a better bed. But if you as God’s servant insist that you must sleep on a more comfortable bed because of your feebleness, then Satan can attack you at this very point and cause you to have an uncomfortable bed to sleep on. To have the mind to suffer denotes that, regardless the condition of the bed, you will work on. If the Lord so arranges for you to sleep on a better bed, do not prefer to sleep on the floor. You should sleep on any kind of bed He provides for you. No matter what the condition of the bed is, you continue to serve and will not shrink back. Such an attitude is what the Scriptures call having the mind to suffer.</p>
          <p>Some brother may be living under a poorer material condition. By this alone it cannot be assumed that he has the mind to suffer. Do not conclude that the materially poorer brother must certainly be one who possesses a greater mind to suffer than a materially better-off brother. Only those who have truly consecrated themselves to the Lord are in possession of such a mind. Such a heart to endure suffering knows no measure nor end. You may go to one place and sleep on the floor. You may go to another place, and there is no floor for you to sleep on but only a pile of hay in the mud. What will you do in such a circumstance? Someone may accept it with great reluctance. Nevertheless, though he suffers, his suffering has a measure or boundary to it. He may be willing to sleep on the floor, but that is the extent to which he can manage the situation—he cannot lower himself further by sleeping in the hay on the muddy ground. By this he seems to say that his standard of living is already low enough and cannot go any lower. This only affirms that he has the fact of suffering in his life but not the mind to suffer.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, there are other brothers and sisters who in their daily living enjoy more material comforts and yet when their standard of living is compelled by circumstance to be lowered, they can take it in stride as though nothing has happened. They can sleep on the floor or even on muddy ground spread with hay. They utter not a word of reluctance or complaint, for they gladly accept the provision. Now this is having a mind to suffer. And God will choose such people to serve Him.</p>
          <p>So our issue today is not over how much we suffer but over what is the measure or boundary to our endurance. Suffering may not be necessary for us, but having the mind to suffer is a must. The Lord will not purposely put us in continuous trial or hardship; He only desires to create in us a mind to suffer. No one who goes forth to serve God can be strong without possessing this kind of mind. Else he will be a feeble workman. He will pity, favor and shed tears for himself at the least difficulty or inconvenience. He will sigh and say, “How have I fallen into such a trying situation!” This reminds me of the instance when on one occasion a sister was weeping. Another sister who had served the Lord many years asked her: “But for whom are you weeping?” Alas, many weep for themselves. They bemoan the fact that, being so lovely and so precious, they have now been demoted into this uninviting, unpleasant place or situation. So they weep for themselves. Such people are the weakest, and they are the quickest to fold when the going gets rough.</p>
          <p>The question before you is this: when trial and pain come your way, where is your heart? On the one hand is your hardship; on the other hand is the Lord’s work. In the event you do not have the mind to suffer, you will immediately sacrifice the work of the Lord. You will muse, “How can I possibly take care of the Lord’s work when I can hardly take care of my distress!” Oh, at all costs, we must arm ourselves with the mind to suffer, for there is no question that our suffering shall indeed subside if we lay down the work; but in so doing God’s work will suffer loss.</p>
          <p>Here, then, is the problem: when there is a lack of a mind to suffer, or when there is no mind present to suffer at all, Satan is able to tempt us to desert our work for the Lord at any time. Yet we are to be people who maintain the glory of God. Come life or come death, we must fulfill our duty. We have to finish our course and persevere to the end. This that I have said is not meant to imply that it is expected that our laboring brothers and sisters are to suffer. Under ordinary situations, our need for food, clothing and lodging is legitimate and good in God’s sight to be met. We do not in the slightest encourage brothers and sisters to seek out sufferings to bear, nor would we ever put suffering upon anyone: we would that God would supply our every need so that we would lack in nothing. Yet we still maintain that to have a mind to suffer is an absolute necessity for those who are God’s workmen. On the one hand, we are aware that God would not withhold any good thing from us; on the other hand, we must possess the mind to suffer. If not, we shall fall at the least inconvenience or trouble.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Four</strong>
          </p>
          <p>How much of a mind to suffer must we possess? The demand of the Scripture is: “faithful unto death” (Rev. 2.10c). In other words, we must be able to endure anything, even death itself. We are not advocating extremes here. Yet having the mind to suffer is never moderately defined in God’s word. If moderation is called for in the case of some of you workers because of excess, then let the Lord, the Church or the more matured brethren temper your excess. But so far as you are concerned, you must give your all. How can you ever serve if you temper yourself? There is no way for you to work. A person who looks upon his own life as precious and loving and who always holds his life in his own hand is very limited in the work of God. Every one of us who would be in God’s service must be prepared to be faithful unto death. This is the only path we can travel. It goes without saying that the Lord will not ask you to die because of your faithfulness. Nonetheless, the preserving of our life is up to the Lord and is not a matter for our concern. Should the Lord so order, that is His business. On our side, we must always be ready to lay down our life. No matter how painful, we must learn to endure.</p>
          <p>Let me say this, that if you live your own life, you will not be able to be faithful unto death. Yet this is the basic demand of the Lord. The mind to suffer should be so strong in us that we may say, “O Lord, it is fine with me if death should come! I am willing to lay down my life for You, totally unmindful of any distressful situation.” God needs such “violent” ones to serve Him (see Matt. 11.12)— those who would dare to put their lives on the line. Let us not worry about how we can avoid being extreme. That is another matter. Here we must realize that though it is impossible for us to pre-arrange everything, it is absolutely necessary that we have this mind to suffer before God. We must be prepared to give our all in the face of outside trouble or physical weakness. If we will not be “violent” with ourselves, then we can do nothing. Let us tell the Lord, “O Lord, I am willing to give my all. Hereafter nothing can hinder my serving You. Come death or life, come sorrow or joy, with You I have cast my lot.”</p>
          <p>This one thing is most effective—that of serving the Lord even unto death. The more you stand on this ground, the less the Enemy has any way with you. Alas, how people love their own selves. A little pain draws out rivers of tears and eruptions of sighs. Were we not to love ourselves, these tears and sighs would vanish from the scene. In order to travel this road God’s servants must be “violent” people. They must say to the Lord, “Lord, whether You have ordained for me to suffer or not, I am fully prepared to suffer.” Again and again I would say that suffering is a limited matter, whereas the mind to suffer is an unlimited one. The amount of hardship or trial the Lord allows you to endure is measurable, but the extent of your readiness to suffer before the Lord is to be immeasurable. On the other hand, if your mind to suffer is measurable, then you do not really have the mind to suffer. Any limit here renders such a person ineffective in the Lord’s work. Anything less than what God demands makes one’s service unacceptable to Him.</p>
          <p>Never entertain the thought that the mind to suffer is restricted to only a certain measure of suffering. No, no, it is to be measureless, even unto death. Otherwise, Satan will be able to tempt you and make you fall. “They overcame him [Satan] because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony; and they loved not their life even unto death” (Rev. 12.11). What can the Enemy do if your conscience is void of offence, you have the word of the testimony of Christ’s victory, and you love not your life even unto death? The Enemy has no way in the slightest to deal with those who love not their lives in that way!</p>
          <p>We all know the story of Job. The reason why Satan attacked him so fiercely is because God’s Enemy just could not believe that a man would not seek to preserve his own life for the Lord’s sake. Hence he challenged Jehovah, saying, “Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face” (Job 2.4-5). Satan knew that if he touched Job’s life and the latter loved his life, then God’s Enemy would have his way. How very clear are the implications of the words in Revelation 12.11: Satan is at his wit’s end towards those who love not their lives even unto death.</p>
          <p>The failure of God’s workmen can be plainly perceived right here—that they love their lives too much. Let us ask ourselves which is more important, the work of God or our own life? our duty to God or our own life? people’s souls or our own life? the Church of God or our own life? the testimony of God on earth or our own life? Those who love themselves cannot serve the Lord: and those who suffer may not necessarily be serving the Lord. Only those who have the mind to suffer, who have an unlimited measure of the mind to suffer, who have a mind that “love[s] not their life even unto death”—these, and these alone, are qualified to serve God.</p>
          <p>Today, let us offer ourselves afresh to the Lord, not offering ourselves to suffer, but simply offering ourselves to give our all. The Lord may not have destined us to be martyrs, yet we must have the mind to suffer even unto a martyr’s death if that be His will. Let us acknowledge and confess how often the failure of our work can be traced to our indolence, self-protection and lack of self-denial. Do not presume that people are blind, that the eyes of other brothers and sisters are closed. Let us realize that they can easily detect whether we are giving our all or keeping back something.</p>
          <p>When the Lord calls us, He calls us to put all on the altar. May He be gracious to us that none of us will so treasure his or her life as to be unwilling to lay it down. From the depths of our hearts we must cultivate the habit of not loving or pitying ourselves. Otherwise, our work will be circumscribed. The measure and extent of our having the mind to suffer will determine the measure and extent of our spiritual work for the Lord. Any limitation in having this mind limits the scope of spiritual service. It also limits the blessing to people. We need not use any other standard by which to measure God’s blessing than that of having the mind to suffer. And with a measureless mind to suffer there shall come an unlimited scope of blessing.</p>
